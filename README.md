# RSSL XML Trace Viewer Tools

The utility was designed for decoding and displaying the value from RSSL XML Tracing log generated by RFA C++/.NET and EMA/ETA C/C++. The main purpose of the project is to create WPF GUI application to display data for [MRN Real-Time News](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/sites/default/files/ThomsonReutersMRNElektronDataModelsv210_2.pdf) provided by RIC MRN_STORY. Anyway the core functionality of the application can be used to decode value of the field entry data inside XML element. Therefore it can use to open RSSL tracing log which contains data from other message model type such as Market Price, Market By Price and Market By Order. This utility should be able to help troubleshooting data issue or confirm the Market Price data or MRN Real-Time news data that API send and receive from Provider Server or TREP component.

## Prerequisites

Required software components:

* [.NET Framework ](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework/net461) - .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later version
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)- We use Visual Studio 2017 to develop WPF GUI applicaiton.

Optional software components:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE for edit source codes and open XML and JSON output from the application.


## Getting Started

The utility can be used on Windows OS only because it uses .NET Framework with WPF library which available for Windows development only. It require Visual Studio 2017 with .NET framework 4.6.1 to build the application. It requires some additional libraries for decoding XML data and parsing the JSON data. The application requires RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def to decode the raw data in Hex string format to the actual value. User can update dictionary inside folder Dict to the latest version. In case that the application unable to find field definition for some specific fid or custom fid and enum value, it will instead display original Hex string with the fid id instead of showing fid name. Note that you can download latest version of data dictionary from the [Software Download page](https://customers.thomsonreuters.com/a/support/technical/softwaredownload/default.aspx) and then search for product name "TREP Template service pack".

Anyway if you want the utility which can run on multiple OS such as mac os and linux, we have created console application which can decode and convert the data from RSSL tracing log to a new XML file. It share the core functionality with the GUI project. You can download it from [github](https://github.com/TR-API-Samples/Example.EMARFACPP.Tool.RSSLXMLTraceConverter).

# Overview

The utilities were designed for decoding data inside RSSL XML trace log which generated by RFA C++/.NET and EMA/ETA C/C++ and it can be used to display decoded data in WPF GUI. Basically, the RSSL XML trace file was provided for troubleshooting purpose only. There is some scenario that it required data from the tracing log to confirm data integrity the application received, therefore, there is the requirement to create a tool which can convert field entry value in Hex string format to actual value so that the user can compare the value with data the application received.

Normally when the application requesting data for Market Price and Level 2 Market By Price or Market by Order, the response message usually contains a field entry with field value in Hex string format. The utility can be used to read the XML Fragment and decode the Hex string in the field entry to actual data according the data type from data dictionary. Moreover it can be used to decode the [MRN Real-Time News](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/introduction-machine-readable-news-mrn-elektron-message-api-ema) which provide by using MRN_STORY Ric. The tools have application's logic to scan the XML Fragment to find a series of compressed MRN fragment data inside the tracing log and then unpack the data and shows the MRN JSON data in the GUI.
